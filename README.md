# 🎯 Advanced Crosshair 

Advanced Crosshair is a lightweight client-side mod that changes the color of your crosshair based on your ability to hit or critical hit an enemy player:

- 🔴 **Red crosshair** when you're in range and can land a **regular hit**. (Sprint hit, sweep hit)

- 🔵 **Blue crosshair** when you're able to land a **critical hit** (falling, midair, etc).

## 🧩 Features

- **Compatible with ANY texturepack.** Unlike Crosshair Indicator.

- Fully client-side. No configuration. No dependancies.

## 📍 Why is this useful?

- Very useful for landing **Punish Crits** and **W-Release Crits** effectively. 
  
- Can help newer players understand and practice hit timing and mechanics

### Give your PvP skills a major upgrade – Advanced Crosshair helps you hit smarter, not harder!
